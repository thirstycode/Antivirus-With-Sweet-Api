## Disclaimer :
- Pro's :
  - This Antivirus Will Never Expire. ðŸ˜ƒ
  - It'll Always Be Updated Since VirustTotal Is Always Updated
  - It Can Detect All Malwares, Viruses, Trojans , everything ðŸ˜ƒ
- Con's :
  - BIG unfortunate update : VirusTotal API has been restricted to 5 back to back scans.
  - So I have added wait time of 60 seconds after every  5th file scanned.
  - I suggest you to use this script to scan for specific folders rather than to scanning whole computer as it'll take much time
- Get log reports is TODO in script.
- PS : I'm not responsible for any harm to your computer [Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯](https://github.com/thirstycode/antivirus-with-sweet-api) ðŸ˜œ
